# NEOM Autonomous Vehicles – Reliability Strategy (AMIR Framework)

This repository contains the code example and documentation related to the Reliability Strategy assignment for the NEOM Autonomous Vehicle system.

## Contents
- Reliability code sample demonstrating fallback mechanism.
- Explanation of redundant sensor logic.
- Part of the reliability architecture implemented in code.

## System Overview
NEOM autonomous vehicles use multiple sensors (LIDAR, radar, camera) and fallback mechanisms to ensure continuous operation even in case of partial system failures.
